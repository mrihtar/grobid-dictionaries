## Purpose

GROBID-Dictionaries is a GROBID sub-project, implementing a java machine learning library, for structuring digitized lexical resources and entry-based documents with encyclopedic or bibliographic content. It allows the parsing, extraction and structuring of text information in such resources. 

## Approach

GROBID-Dictionaries is based on cascading CRF models. The diagram below presents the architecture enabling the processing and the transfer of the text information through the models.

![GROBID Dictionaries Structure](docs/img/modelsIn.png)

__Dictionary Segmentation__
This is the first model and has as goal the segmentation of each dictionary page into 3 main blocks: Headnote, Body and Footnote. Another block, "dictScarp" could be generated for text information that do not belong to the principal blocks

__Dictionary Body Segmentation__
The second model gets the Body, recognized by the first model, and processes it to recognize the boundaries of each lexical entry.

__Lexical Entry__
The third model parses each lexical entry, recognized by the second model, to segment it into 4 main blocks: Form, Etymology, Senses, Related Entries. A "dictScrap" block is there as well for unrecognised information. 


__The rest of the models__
The same logic applies respectively for the recognised blocks in a lexical entry by having a specific model for each one of them


*N.B*: The current architecture could change at any milestone of the project, as soon as new ideas or technical constraints emerge. 

## Input/Output

GROBID-Dictionaries takes as input lexical resources digitized in PDF format. Each model of the aforementioned components generates a TEI P5-encoded hierarchy of the different recognized text structures at that specific cascading level.
